# retirement-planner
A rudimentary retirement planner built in COBOL. Use it to help plan your retirement.

Rudimentary Retirement Planner v1

This application can be downloaded and run directly on the host machine. No need to run it on a mainframe and no need to use JCL (Job Control Language) unless you really want to. 
The website http://148.100.77.149 and the COBOL file are hosted on an IBM z15 mainframe, on a virtual machine of RHEL8.2 (Red Hat Enterprise Linux). Make sure you have COBOL installed on your computer, virtual machine, or on the mainframe so that you can download the file and run it.
The program will ask the user the current age, the age of retirement, the current money, the rate of yearly return, and the yearly deposit amount, and then calculate the total amount at the retirement age.
The website expires on 2021-09-25, but you can check my GitHub and download the program when the website expires.
